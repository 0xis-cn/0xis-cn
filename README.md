## Using GitHub under protest

[![Please don't upload to GitHub](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg)](https://nogithub.codeberg.page)

I am trying to stay away from GitHub, which is a hypocritical FOSS supporter and a bad place for software development. I invite you to read the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign or [a concise essay](https://ploum.net/2023-02-22-leaving-github.html) by Ploum.
