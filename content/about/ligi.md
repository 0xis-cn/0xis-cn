Traditionally, numerous Sinosphere writers adopt a pseudonym ([*hào*, *gō*, *ho*, or *tên hiệu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_name), GCR spelling *haw*) according to their residence or workplace. Liáng Qǐchāo (Liang Keetyau), as a random example, named himself that redundantly translated to ‘the host of ice-drinker’s studio’.

In [Muqliong Gang](@/blog/2022-05-14-childhood.md), the spiritual homeland of my childhood, I created Ligi Studio affiliated to the Gang. It, along with Mocsieng Workshop, was institutionalised in late Muqliong as an outreach for education, research, and… well pure make-believe. It is somewhat evidential to date the establishment to around 877 DM.

We children were of course vulnerable in defensing our fantasy, so Muqliong was mostly just big talk. Writing down these words, however, I realised that I have done everything possible in the secluded town. The works within two years are not idle daydreams. *Zienndzaehienzhag*, a fiction-themed vertical app (yes, it *was installable*) and another official product. Filming and editing of late Muqliong DVs. Visual design and maintenance of a Minecraft live stream named after the studio. Failed mechanic-fashional prototype laid in the bungalow. Various works for administrators.

Conclusion: My later, ordinary self must have been cursed Original Sin…

I dare not boast to be luckier than those who once claimed to be millionaires or god-descendants, since I still have a shot at catching up with my past imagination. At the age Hu Shih abandoned his workplace name, refusing to ‘shield [his] brilliance’ any longer, I do exactly the opposite. Below are the works I believe still deserve the honour of bearing Ligi Studio’s name.
