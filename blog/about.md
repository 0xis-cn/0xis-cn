## About my name

{::nomarkdown}
<details>
<summary>Matling, from <i>mat</i> as in <i>material</i> and <i>-ling</i>, suffix for a follower.</summary>
<p>Ahem.
<p>This content is solely for though pedantic enough. <cite>Tsieushaeng Fuh</cite> by Euyang Sieu:</p>
<blockquote>The verdant is unsentimental, fading into nothing now and then. Humans are animals, but the paragon of them.<br>草木无情，有时飘零。人为动物，惟物之灵。</blockquote>
<p>‘<i>mat</i> as in <i>material</i>’ is an interpretation under
Sky Darmos’ constructed script adapting Chinese characters to the Germanic
  languages, which I called Siaudzih.</p>

## About matling.fit

### Why 2038?

The name of [2038](https://github.com/0xis-cn/2038),
a Jekyll theme by my own, is a reference to — not that you already know —
a song by Yi An Musical released in 2018.
It is a song that whispered the possibility of a future of oblivion
and the demise of their musician dreams.
Alas, the song, according to some, turned out to be a crystal ball.

Traits for design include

- Vertical rhythm for lead typesetting
- No border design (Cards are muddy!)
- ~~Largely JavaScript-free~~ (Withdrawn, [even not this](http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/))
- Adjustable as in [Citizen](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Citizen)

Unfortunately, the code in GitHub repository is outdated, particularly
redundant and not complying with modern CSS.
I should have been more decisive —
the old code is controversial when I take both retrocomputing and free from JavaScript into account.

### A timeline for progenitors

2011
: The birth of a website of Muqliong Gang in Microsoft FrontPage,
with 'eye-protecting' orchid-coloured
[table layout](http://www.tiernok.com/posts/history-of-html-table-layouts.html),
reading 'it is our eternal pursuit to help more people realise their dreams'.
Not knowing how to publish it online, I requested fellows of the Gang to
manually create the same directory.

2012
: Some earliest posts here, basically writing tasks for elementary school students,
can be found in [zww.cn](https://www.zww.cn/).
Others were published on QZone, a private SNS
then crammed with 'not a doomsday but a cherishing year!'.

2018
: A blog with Hexo, with a 'futuristic' collection of practice questions on physics,
was first time deployed online with [CODING](https://coding.net/).
Writing elsewhere on algorithm at the same time; I will include them
as long as the format is ready.

2020
: Revived my blog after gāokǎo. Migrated to Jekyll.

21 May 2021
: Registered the domain name later changed (for spelling reezon) to matling.fit.
Theme switched to 2038 designed in a fortnight.

11 Mar 2024
: 'Many blogs are prone to desolation for lack management'... Well, some sort.
Rearranged the repository.
