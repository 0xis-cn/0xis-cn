The earliest posts were published on zww.cn. Users could submit essays to the site, though its preset categories far exceeded typical essay topics. Based on the misspelled date at the end of the text, it should have been written in 256 DM, but all zww.cn posts are said to date around this time. It is unrealistic that I have written them rapidly over several days and then forgot about the site.

I made an excuse to include these posts, that they were originally published on the public web and even crawled several times.

In 2022, Lu Changhai discussed the [Rare Homepage Hypothesis](https://www.changhai.org/articles/technology/misc/RarePage.php) analogous to the Rare Earth Hypothesis. He argued that personal websites like his, handcrafted, self-programmed, hosting extensive writings, and enduring, are scarce on the internet. What you are reading is too late as a contestant. However I know well that the worth of my writing depends on the worth of my life. Hereby I authorize all internet service providers to disregard user aggrements and delete my information when that moment arrives. I may have generated terabytes of data, but never contributed a single bit of value for humanity.

A brief explanation of this letter, absurd even to me: This magazine (not a ‘book’) likely witnessed many childhoods. I only recall that many words were looked up in a yellowed old dictionary (one I never saw again). I cannot explain the typos.
