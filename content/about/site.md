## About my name

Call me **Matling**, <bdi lang="uk">Матлін</bdi>, <bdi>متلينغ</bdi>, ᎹᏟᏂ, ᒪᑦᓕᖕ, 物灵, or 𑂧𑂞𑂪𑂱𑂑.

<details>
<summary><b>Etymology&emsp;</b>From <i>mat</i> as in <i>material</i> and <i>-ling</i>, suffix for a follower.</summary>
<p>Ahem.
<p>For though pedantic enough, I attribute the name to <cite>Tsieushaeng Fuh</cite> by Euyang Sieu.</p>
<blockquote>The verdant is unsentimental, fading into nothing now and then. Humans are animals, but the paragon of them.<br>草木无情，有时飘零。人为动物，惟物之灵。</blockquote>
<p>Surface analysis influenced by Sky Darmos’ <cite>The German Language in Chinese Script</cite>. The quackery is adequate for <a href="https://lex.matling.fit/divpolis.html">a foundation of recreational art</a>.

<p>To Latinize, insert my legal name to <span style="filter:blur(2px)">***** ****</span> Matlina. In Chinese Sign Language, possibly nicknamed <span lang="csl" title="">𝠀𝪟𝪨𝠀𝪟𝤅𝣅𝪟𝣅𝪟𝪨𝡶𝪨</span>.

Pronouns are [any except ambiguous](https://en.pronouns.page/any). Other than ‘I/me’, I exceedingly [call myself](https://mzh.moegirl.org.cn/特殊第一人称) ‘Liengtz’ (always in Wu: lin˨ tsz̩) these days, influenced by a Wuhan-based beauty influencer with motivational experiences.

I do not mind being addressed by legal name. It is not included here for historical reason.

## Designing matling.fit

### The theme 2038

The name of [2038](https://github.com/0xis-cn/2038),
a Jekyll theme by my own, is a reference to — not that you already know —
a song by Yi An Musical released in 2018.
It is a song that whispered the possibility of a future of oblivion
and the demise of their musician dreams.
Alas, the song, according to some, [turned out to be a crystal ball]({% post_url 2025-06-17-ianjunghak-siuhu-2038nen %}).

Traits for design include

- Vertical rhythm for lead typesetting
- Borderless (Cards are muddy! But to coordinate borderless texts is tricky and I am questioning my outcome)
- JavaScript-free (Near-perfect sans JavaScript, but not for [any browser](http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/))
- Adjustable as in [Citizen](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Citizen)

Unfortunately, the code in GitHub repository is outdated, particularly
redundant and not complying with modern CSS.
I should have been more decisive —
the old code is controversial when I take both retrocomputing and free from JavaScript into account.

### A timeline for progenitors

<dl class=ml-card-list>
<dt>2011
<dd>The birth of a website of Muqliong Gang in Microsoft FrontPage,
with ‘eye-protecting’ orchid-coloured table layout,
reading ‘it is our eternal pursuit to help more people realise their dreams’.
Not knowing how to publish it online, I requested fellows of the Gang to
manually create the same directory.

<dt>2012
<dd>Some earliest posts are published in Facebook-influenced websites, including
zww.cn, xxt.cn (<a href="http://blog.xxt.cn/459358784">weathered blog</a>), and QQ,
where I remembered were crammed with ‘not apocalypse but cherishing year!’.

<dt>2018
<dd>A blog with Hexo, with a ‘futuristic’ collection of practice questions on physics,
was first time deployed online with CODING.
It has been 2018 but I was still centering a div with <code>translate(-50%, -50%)</code>.
After the service adjustment I moved to Gitee.
Writing elsewhere on algorithm at the same time; I may or may not include them later.

<dt>2020
<dd>Revived my blog after gāokǎo. Migrated to Jekyll.

<dt>21 May 2021
<dd>Registered the domain name later changed (for spelling reezon) to matling.fit.
Theme switched to 2038 designed in a fortnight.

<dt>Mar 2024
<dd>‘Many blogs are prone to desolation for lack management’ (<a href="https://vistudium.top/">hulenkius</a>). Well, some sort.
Rearranged the repository.

<dt>10 Sep 2025
<dd>Migrated to Zola.

### Might stop now

This will never become another [Gwern](https://gwern.net/design)-like self-reveal. Nevertheless, 2038 stemmed when I believed I had been more design-minded.

The traits Gwern and I shared were developed independently. Though Gwern’s innovation is elegant and flawless, I have found myself accustomed to it, for example, leaving the cursor on hyperlinks as short as possible to avoid loading a pop-up. The active work-around clearly denotes an antipattern.

## Languages

A post may have not been translated or written in obscure language because it pertains language-specific background knowledge or is intended to stress test that language, which will be less frequent in the future as this blog aims to provide worldwide perspectives.
Or because it was written at a young age and only archived.

The customary romanization of Chinese names in this website and my creative works is [General Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Chinese), a neutral orthography invented by Yuen Ren Chao. General Chinese, along with its successors such as Branner (1999), Norman (2006), and Gu & Simmons (2016), is helpful for grasping the subtlety of proper names, even homonymous, for non-native speakers, though not rather linguistically well-supported. See also [my mockery](@/blog/2025-03-31-enhypen-alphabet.md).
