<h3>Why 2038?</h3>
<p>The name of <a href="https://github.com/0xis-cn/2038">2038</a>, a Jekyll theme by my own, is a reference to — not that you already know — a song by Yi An Musical released in 2018. It is a song that whispered the possibility of a future of oblivion and the demise of their musician dreams. Alas, the song, according to some, turned out to be a crystal ball.
