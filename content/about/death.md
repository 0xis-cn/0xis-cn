Hope that everything goes well, and that I have dedicated my life to people like you.

Muqliong, Ling’ien Coc, and Shidinn Community are wider communities worthwhile to be informed. And class correspondents. I mean primary members if a listed community has been defunct.

I would like my unanthologized work and data not counted as work to be destroyed. This could mean immediately putting out the website you are reading. Even [anthologized work](@/about/ligi.md) might be preserved under selection, for any of my work can be considered reflecting only vague possibility that have unfortunately demised. Leave a hand-picked physical archive, not a mummy of unproductive records scattered across data centres.
