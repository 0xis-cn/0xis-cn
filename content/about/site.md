A mechanic psychic, a maudlin clarion, and an [Oreki丶](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Oreki%E4%B8%B6) fanboy.

## Name

Call me **Matling**, <bdi lang="uk">Матлін</bdi>, <bdi>متلينغ</bdi>, ᎹᏟᏂ, ᒪᑦᓕᖕ, 物灵, or 𑂧𑂞𑂪𑂱𑂑.

<details>
<summary><b>Etymology&emsp;</b>From <i>mat</i> as in <i>material</i> and <i>-ling</i>, suffix for a follower.</summary>
<p>Ahem.
<p>For though pedantic enough, I attribute the name to <cite>Tsieushaeng Fuh</cite> by Euyang Sieu.</p>
<blockquote>The verdant is unsentimental, fading into nothing now and then. Humans are animals, but the paragon of them.<br>草木无情，有时飘零。人为动物，惟物之灵。</blockquote>
<p>Surface analysis influenced by Sky Darmos’ <cite>The German Language in Chinese Script</cite>. The quackery is adequate for <a href="https://lex.matling.fit/divpolis.html">a foundation of recreational art</a>.

<p>Latinized names tend to follow ‘foous barus myvarus’ pattern, where I have no interest. I call for a Chinese Sign Language nickname that may start with <span lang="csl" title="SignWriting text">𝠀𝪟𝪨𝠀𝪟𝤅𝣅𝪟</span>.

Pronouns are [any except ambiguous](https://en.pronouns.page/any). Other than ‘I/me’, I exceedingly [call myself](https://mzh.moegirl.org.cn/特殊第一人称) ‘Liengtz’ (always in Wú: lin˨ tsz̩) these days, influenced by a Wǔhàn-based beauty influencer with motivational experiences.

[^legal-name]: The only reason to have a pseudonym was, as a teenager supported by family, I fear my family be involved because of my name. Years later, they say when I disclosed the reason, ‘that’s unreasonable. You are independent in whatever economic status.’

I do not mind being addressed by legal name.[^legal-name] It is not included here for historical reason.

## Designing matling.fit

### The theme 2038

The name of 2038 is a reference to — not that you already know —
a song by Yi An Musical released in 2018.
It is a song that whispered the possibility of a future of oblivion
and the demise of their musician dreams.
Alas, the song, according to some, [turned out to be a crystal ball](@/blog/2025-06-17-ianjunghak-siuhu-2038nen.md).

Traits for design include

[^borderless]: To coordinate borderless texts is tricky and I am questioning my outcome.

- Vertical rhythm for lead typesetting
- Borderless (Cards are muddy![^borderless])
- JavaScript-free (Near-perfect sans JavaScript, but not for [any browser](http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/))
- Adjustable as in [Citizen](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Citizen)

[The codebase](https://github.com/0xis-cn/2038) is archived and ill-organized.

### A timeline for progenitors

<dl class=ml-card-list>
<dt>2011
<dd>The birth of a website of Muqliong Gang in Microsoft FrontPage,
with ‘eye-protecting’ orchid-coloured table layout,
reading ‘it is our eternal pursuit to help more people realise their dreams’.
Not knowing how to publish it online, I requested fellows of the Gang to
manually create the same directory.

<dt>2012
<dd>Some earliest posts are published in Facebook-influenced websites, including
zww.cn, xxt.cn (<a href="http://blog.xxt.cn/459358784">weathered blog</a>), and QQ,
where I remembered were crammed with ‘not apocalypse but cherishing year!’.

<dt>2018
<dd>A blog with Hexo, with a ‘futuristic’ collection of practice questions on physics,
was first time deployed online with CODING.
It has been 2018 but I was still centering a div with <code>translate(-50%, -50%)</code>.
After the service adjustment I moved to Gitee.
Writing elsewhere on algorithm at the same time; I may or may not include them later.

<dt>2020
<dd>Revived my blog after gāokǎo. Migrated to Jekyll.

<dt>21 May 2021
<dd>Registered the domain name later changed (for spelling reezon) to matling.fit.
Theme switched to 2038 designed in a fortnight.

<dt>Mar 2024
<dd>‘Many blogs are prone to desolation for lack management’ (<a href="https://vistudium.top/">hulenkius</a>). Well, some sort.
Rearranged the repository.

<dt>10 Sep 2025
<dd>Migrated to Zola.

<dt>15 Jan 2025
<dd>Minor design revamp.
</dl>

### Might stop now

This will never become another [Gwern](https://gwern.net/design)-like self-reveal. Nevertheless, 2038 stemmed when I believed I had been more design-minded.

The traits Gwern and I shared were developed independently. Though Gwern’s innovative UI is elegant and flawless, I have found myself accustomed to it, for example, leaving the cursor on hyperlinks as short as possible to avoid loading a pop-up. The active work-around clearly denotes an antipattern.

## Languages

The reason for pages to be not translated or available only in obscure languages because it depends on language-specific background knowledge or is intended to stress test that language, which will be less frequent in the future as this blog aims to provide worldwide perspectives.
Or because it was written at a young age and only archived.

[^pinyin]: An alternative I have considered is subscript-marked Pīnyīn similar to [Zhihong](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhihong627) (e.g. zhéᵗmùᵏ for *jetmuc*). It is more ISO-compliant by including full Pīnyīn but, well, kay(f)bop(t)-y. Though myself being a Shidinnist, Shidinn is under consideration since it drifts further from ‘average Chinese’.

The customary romanization of Chinese names in matling.fit and my creative works is [General Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Chinese), a neutral orthography invented by Yuen Ren Chao. General Chinese, along with its successors such as Branner (1999), Norman (2006), and Gu & Simmons (2016), is helpful for grasping the subtlety of proper names, even homonymous, for non-native speakers,[^pinyin] though not rather linguistically well-supported. See also [my mockery](@/blog/2025-03-31-enhypen-alphabet.md).

## Site info

### Publication date

DM (in the days of Muqliong) denote days starting from 1 May 2011, when
Muqliong Gang was approximately formed. For more details, refer to [Lexicon Matlini](https://lex.matling.fit/days-of-muqliong.html).

### AI usage

[^ce]: [This](@/blog/2025-05-31-my-path-after-twenty-years.md) and [this](@/blog/2025-05-02-a-slice-of-bash-programmable-completion.md).

Except for older posts[^ce] or quotes, original content in matling.fit does not include output from generative AI models.

This holds for the original version of multilingual posts. Translations are typically made with LLMs and thoroughly proofread primarily to keep the nuances and style; I do not publish unproofread translations.
