Enhypen Alphabet is a language-neutral spelling system for Chinese characters, specifically for Chinese-derived proper names. It bears less prejudice from Mandarin, as compared to Yuen Ren Chao’s [General Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Chinese) and Professor [Gu Qian](https://chin.nju.edu.cn/English/Faculty/AppliedLinguistics/20230516/i246356.html)’s *Common Sound Systems of Chinese Dialects*, where the bias is more or less dedicated.

It serves as a startpoint to ‘Sinicize’ respective for tacit perceptions of characters, which is barely possible for natural languages, stubborn for previous works, and Shidinn leads to the other extreme.

Named after the South Korean boy band in the early development, the scheme is redefined as the backronym ‘empirical nominal hyperlingual notation’. As an April Fool's Day post written under extreme pressure, the omissions are not planned to be corrected.

## Initials   

Inherited from Sampson’s spelling of Old Chinese (matched through phonemes, but seen from jurisdiction only slightly drifted), which is nearly identical to General Chinese except for the use of voiced letters.

For tones, options include

- c for departing and h for going tone, as Sampson (who prefers s to h).
- As in General Chinese, duplicate the vowel for departing tone (possibly hard to recognise) and ‘intensify’ the last letter for going tone.  
- Use diacritics or numerals [as my friend](https://lanlanfiction.fandom.com/zh/wiki/%E6%8B%89%E4%B8%81%E5%8C%96%E6%96%B0%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97).

## Notes

Biblography:

- [The coolest conlang ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFGA8AicyBs)
- [Even cooler language adaptation](https://lamiz.fandom.com/zh/wiki/)

The letter ɵ features [Wu pronunciation](https://zhuyuhao.com/) as /ø/. Cantonese /ɔ/ (occasionally; along with ‘Classical Mandarin’ [if existed](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/694540340)) is barely acceptable [according to my friend](https://lanlanfiction.fandom.com/zh/wiki/%E5%85%B1%E9%80%9A%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%9A%E5%AD%97%E6%AF%8D).
