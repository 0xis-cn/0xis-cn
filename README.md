## Using GitHub under protest

[![Please don't upload to GitHub](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg)](https://nogithub.codeberg.page)

I am trying to stay away from GitHub, which is a hypocritical FOSS supporter and a bad place for software development. I invite you to read the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign or [a concise essay](https://ploum.net/2023-02-22-leaving-github.html) by Ploum.

The reason I am still here is that GitHub has degenerated into a social network, which means that the use of GitHub is no longer a professional choice. As in all other social networks,

> Developers are now raw meat encouraged to get stars, followers and commit counters, doing the most stupid things in the most appealing way to get... visibility! Yeah! Engagement! Followers! Audience!

For projects I developed alone, you are welcomed to inquire me via email.
