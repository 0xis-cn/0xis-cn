I just wrote hasty words when the class is beginning.

I referred to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf4T2MuOI8I),
and attempted to rephrase so that you would not find it too stale.

If you really care about fancy concepts on general information management,
[Supermemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/) and
[Andy ºs working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/) are worth reading.

There should have been topics presented by our group as well. But ahem,
it is unrealistic for us to explain profoundly how to do research.
