> I know I have been forgotten  
> This voyage wanders on and on  
> But call me when the time comes  
> When the East sees another dawn
> 
> I know I have been forgotten  
> Our departure is long past  
> But call me when the time comes  
> When men see blue skies at last
> 
> I know I have been forgotten  
> Our solar story is over now  
> But call me when the time comes  
> When blossoms hang from every bough
